## Motivation behind the project 💚

I love dogs and cats. They were part of my life and always played an important role in the good and hard times.
Whenever something bad happens regardless of whether it's my dog or cat, I'm always very sad. 
I've been noticing a lot of disorganization and little information for those people who want to adopt a pet. 
My idea is to build up a platform that has all the information about pets in a standardized way and can put in contact those who want to donate with those who want to adopt a pet.
I have no intention of making a profit.
What I want is to provide a home for  pets that are abandoned and alone.🐕
